# Confetti Experiment

This code creates a canvas element and uses JavaScript to generate an array of confetti particles with random colors, sizes, and velocities. The `drawConfetti` function clears the canvas and draws each confetti particle in its current position, updating its position and removing it from the array if it goes off-screen. The `requestAnimationFrame` method is used to create a smooth animation loop.
